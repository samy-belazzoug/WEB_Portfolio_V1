        <h2> Got it since child </h2>
        <p> 
            I grew up playing videos games, exploring software and websites. 
            In high school, I've discovered the world of code and I loved it. 
            Now, I am studying and developping videos games, software and website to professionally contribute to the world.

        <h2> Fueled with passion </h2>
        <p>
            I have always had a fondness for fast things. Cars are definitely part of it, especially race cars. 
            Excellence, innovation, teamwork are the core values of motorsport, and they have been successfully transmitted to me.
            Working with these values can only leads to success, and they are the fuel of my work.
